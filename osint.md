# Open Source Intelligence Resources

## [Google](https://www.google.com/)

Google is a fantastic resource for OSINT. Often things as simple as
searching for your target yields spectacular results. This is often my
starting point in intelligence gathering. Remember to use Cached
results whenever possible to conceal your identity. 

### Double Quotes

Exact matches help narrow things down when you have thousands of
results. Enclosing items such as names and email addresses in
quotation marks helps pinpoint your search results:

- Exact match: "Firstname Lastname"
- Email addresses: "user@host.com"

### Site operator

Searching for a term on a specific site or domain:

- site:localnewssite.com "Firstname Lastname"
